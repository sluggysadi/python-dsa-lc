    "- Lists\n",
    "    - A list is an ordered collection of zero or more references to Python data objects. \n",
    "    Lists are written as comma-delimited values enclosed in square brackets. The empty list is simply [ ]. Lists are heterogeneous, \n",
    "    meaning that the data objects need not all be from the same class and the collection can be assigned to a variable as below. \n",
    "    The following fragment shows a variety of Python data objects in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operations on any SEQUENCE (Lists, Strings, Tuples) in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remember elements start at 0 not 1\n",
    "    - Indexing: [] Access an element of a sequence\n",
    "    - Concactenation: + Combine sequences together\n",
    "    - Repetition: * Concatenate a repeated number of times\n",
    "    - Membership: in Ask whether an item is in a sequence\n",
    "    - Length: len Ask the number of items in the sequence\n",
    "    - Slicing [:] Extract a part of a sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "- Range function: Return a sequence of numbers range (start,end,count)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods on Lists:\n",
    "*Mutable: Can be modified\n",
    "    - append\t    alist.append(item)\t    Adds a new item to the end of a list\n",
    "    - insert\t    alist.insert(i,item)    Inserts an item at the ith position in a list\n",
    "    - pop\t        alist.pop()\t            Removes and returns the last item in a list\n",
    "    - pop\t        alist.pop(i)\t        Removes and returns the ith item in a list\n",
    "    - sort\t        alist.sort()\t        Modifies a list to be sorted\n",
    "    - reverse\t    alist.reverse()\t        Modifies a list to be in reverse order\n",
    "    - del\t        del alist[i]\t        Deletes the item in the ith position\n",
    "    - index\t        alist.index(item)\t    Returns the index of the first occurrence of item\n",
    "    - count\t        alist.count(item)\t    Returns the number of occurrences of item\n",
    "    - remove\t    alist.remove(item)\t    Removes the first occurrence of item\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An ndarray is a multidimensional, homogeneous collection of items of the same type and size. Unlike lists, they are optimized for numerical \n",
    "    computation and memory efficiency. Arrays are fixed-size at creation; changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original. \n",
    "    Operations are vectorized, meaning mathematical operations are applied to every element in the array at once without the need for explicit loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating Arrays \n",
    "    - np.array([1, 2, 3]) Create an array from a Python list\n",
    "    - np.zeros(shape) Create an array filled with 0s\n",
    "    - np.ones(shape) Create an array filled with 1s\n",
    "    - np.arange(start, stop, step) Similar to Python range(), but returns an array\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods on NumPy Arrays:\n",
    "*Many methods return a result rather than modifying the array in place\n",
    "    - reshape       anarr.reshape(r, c)     Returns an array with a new shape without changing data\n",
    "    - flatten       anarr.flatten()         Returns a copy of the array collapsed into one dimension\n",
    "    - transpose     anarr.T                 Returns the array with axes transposed (rows/cols flipped)\n",
    "    - mean          anarr.mean()            Returns the average of all elements\n",
    "    - sum           anarr.sum()             Returns the sum of all elements\n",
    "    - max           anarr.max()             Returns the maximum value in the array\n",
    "    - min           anarr.min()             Returns the minimum value in the array\n",
    "    - argmax        anarr.argmax()          Returns the index of the maximum value\n",
    "    - astype        anarr.astype(type)      Returns a copy of the array cast to a new type\n",
    "    - dot anarr.dot   (other)               Performs matrix multiplication (or use the @ operator)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strings: \n",
    "   - Strings are sequential collections of zero or more letters, numbers and other symbols. We call these letters, numbers and other symbols characters. \n",
    "   Literal string values are differentiated from identifiers by using quotation marks (either single or double).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods on Strings\n",
    "*Immutable: Cant be modified\n",
    "    - center\tastring.center(w)\tReturns a string centered in a field of size w\n",
    "    - count\t    astring.count(item)\tReturns the number of occurrences of item in the string\n",
    "    - ljust\t    astring.ljust(w)\tReturns a string left-justified in a field of size w\n",
    "    - lower\t    astring.lower()\t    Returns a string in all lowercase\n",

    "    - find\t    astring.find(item)\tReturns the index of the first occurrence of item\n",
    "    - split\t    astring.split(schar)\tSplits a string into substrings at schar\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing SO IMPORTANT:\n",
    "    - Using slicing, we can extract substrings from a string. The syntax for slicing is string[start:end:step], where start is the starting index, end is the ending index (exclusive), and step is the interval between characters to include.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "      text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "        substring = text[0:5]  # Extracts \"Hello\"\n",
    "        when string is empty, it defaults to start=0, end=len(string), step=1\n",
    "\n",
    "    def is_palindrome(s):\n",
    "    return s == s[::-1]\n",
    "- Tuples:\n",
    "    - Tuples are very similar to lists in that they are heterogeneous (mult data types) sequences of data. The difference is that a tuple is immutable, like a string.\n",
    "      A tuple cannot be changed. Tuples are written as comma-delimited values enclosed in parentheses. As sequences, they can use any operation described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example: myTuple = (2, True, 3.5, \"Hello\")\n",
    "    - myTuple[0,2] --> (2, True)\n",
    "    - len(myTuple) --> 4\n",
    "    - myTuple * 2 --> (2, True, 3.5, \"Hello\", 2, True, 3.5, \"Hello\")\n",
    "    - myTuple[1]=False --> TypeError: object doesn't support item assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sets: \n",
    "    - A set is an unordered collection of zero or more immutable Python data objects. Sets do not allow duplicates and are written as comma-delimited values \n",
    "      enclosed in curly braces.\n",
    "    - Example: mySet = {3,6,\"cat\",4.5,False}\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operations on Sets:\n",
    "    - membership\tin\t                Set membership\n",
    "    - length\t    len\t                Returns the cardinality of the set\n",
    "    - |\t            aset | otherset\t    Returns a new set with all elements from both sets\n",
    "    - &\t            aset & otherset\t    Returns a new set with only those elements common to both sets\n",
    "    - --\t        aset - otherset\t    Returns a new set with all items from the first set not in second\n",
    "    - <=\t        aset <= otherset\tAsks whether all elements of the first set are in the second\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods on Sets: \n",
    "    - union\t        aset.union(otherset)\t    Returns a new set with all elements from both sets\n",
    "    - intersection\taset.intersection(otherset)\tReturns a new set with only those elements common to both sets\n",
    "    - difference\taset.difference(otherset)\tReturns a new set with all items from first set not in second\n",
    "    - issubset\t    aset.issubset(otherset)\t    Asks whether all elements of one set are in the other\n",
    "    - add\t        aset.add(item)\t            Adds item to the set\n",
    "    - remove\t    aset.remove(item)\t        Removes item from the set\n",
    "    - pop\t        aset.pop()\t                Removes an arbitrary element from the set\n",
    "    - clear\t        aset.clear()\t            Removes all elements from the set\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dictionaries:\n",
    "    -  Dictionaries are collections of associated pairs of items where each pair consists of a key and a value. This key-value pair is typically written as key:value. \n",
    "    Dictionaries are written as comma-delimited key:value pairs enclosed in curly braces. For example,\n",
    "    - Example: capitals = {'Iowa':'DesMoines','Wisconsin':'Madison'}\n",
    "\n",
    "- Methods on Dictionaries:\n",
    "    - keys\t    adict.keys()\t    Returns the keys of the dictionary in a dict_keys object\n",
    "    - values\tadict.values()\t    Returns the values of the dictionary in a dict_values object\n",
    "    - items\t    adict.items()\t    Returns the key-value pairs in a dict_items object\n",

    "- Linked Lists\n",
    "    - O(n) while binary search is Olog(n)\n",
    "    - Linked lists --> less searching, more insertions/deletions\n",
