# Python DSA & LeetCode Roadmap
### This repository is a dedicated space for my journey through Data Structures, Algorithms, and Python-specific practice. My goal is to build a deep understanding of problem-solving patterns and efficient code implementation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Master core Data Structures (Trees, Graphs, Linked Lists, etc.).
- Implement common Algorithms from scratch to understand time/space complexity.
- Solve LeetCode problems categorized by pattern (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, etc.).

## 📂 Repository Structure
- LeetCode: Solutions categorized by difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard).
- DSA: Standard implementations of stacks, queues, heaps, and sorting algorithms.
- Python_Practice: Exercises on decorators, generators, and advanced Python syntax.
